                            I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, which is the capital city of Guangdong province. Guangdong is the province where Cantonese is spoken, and Cantonese cuisine is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese cuisine. Cantonese cuisine has a very long history, and it is known for its variety of ingredients, cooking methods, and flavors. In this blog post, I will introduce some of my favorite Cantonese dishes.

                            Double-skin milk is a Cantonese dessert made with milk, egg whites, and sugar. It is called "double-skin" because it has two layers of milk skin. The first layer is formed when the milk is heated, and the second layer is formed when the milk is cooled. The dessert is very smooth and creamy, and it has a very delicate flavor. It is usually served cold, and it is a perfect dessert for hot summer days.

                    <p>
                    Over the last few months in Guangzhou, China, I have had the opportunity to try some unique Cantonese food
                    from all over the city. Some of them are well known dishes internationally, while some are rather exotic
                    cuisine that are only popular locally. I will be introducing a few of them here in my blog from my personal
                    tasting experience.
